# Eat-Da-Burger

## **Usage**

This app utilizes a database to add a burger, devour it, and delete it.

## **Description**

This homework assignment tossed quite a few new concepts at us all at once. First, we learned about the MVC(Model-View-Controller) file structure. This was pretty tough to grasp and follow right away because it really splits the code up into a lot more files and requires you to link all the code together between files. There's a lot more files to look through, but it's worth it to learn this design pattern as it can save a lot of time and frustration in the future for any updates that may need to happen.

The second concept was learning about ORM(object-relational mapping). This is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented programming language. Essentially, we can interact with our database using our language of choice instead of SQL. I created a homemade ORM to use in this assignment.

And lastly, we learned how to deploy a MySQL project to heroku. There are some extra steps to set up a JawsDB remote database but with good documentation, it was no big deal.

This project also used Node, Express.js, and Handlebars to complete.

## **Link**

The app is deployed on heroku [here](https://eat-da-burger-pp.herokuapp.com/).
